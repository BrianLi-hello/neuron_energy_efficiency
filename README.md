# Simulation code 
1. Check if [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) are installed on your machine
2. Run all in ``standard_feedforward_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``standard_feedforward_ANN.png``
3. Run all in ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.png``
