# Investigating Energy Efficiency in Biological Neurons and Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains the code behind "[Box URL Link for Powerpoint]"

Author: Brian Li (in collaboration with UC Davis Center Neuroscience Chaudhuri Lab)

# Simulation code 
1. Check if [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) are installed on your machine
2. Run all in ``standard_feedforward_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``standard_feedforward_ANN.png``
3. Run all in ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.ipynb`` to generate ``biological_neuron_inspiried_ANN.png``


# Information on diagram
- Run all in ``mnist_images.ipynb`` to generate ``mnist_images.png``
- Run all in ``relu.ipynb`` to generate ``relu.png``
- This [website](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/index.html) was used to generate the neural network architecture diagrams
